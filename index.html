        <p class="para">The Chrome Dino game, also known as the Chrome Dinosaur or T-Rex game, was introduced by Google in
            2014 as a fun way to entertain users when they were offline and couldn't load web pages. The game features a
            simple T-Rex dinosaur that players control by jumping over obstacles like cacti and birds. The game was designed
            to be simple and addictive, with the T-Rex running faster as the game progresses.</p>

            As for the highest score, the game doesn't have an official leaderboard, but players have reported reaching
            incredible scores. The maximum possible score is 99,999, after which the game resets. Some dedicated players
            have managed to hit this score, but it takes a lot of skill and patience...good luck !!!</p>
